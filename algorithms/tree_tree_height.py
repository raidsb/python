"""
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. For example, the following binary tree is of height :

Function Description
Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.
getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):
â€¢ root: a reference to the root of a binary tree.
Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer , the number of nodes in the tree.
Next line contains  space separated integer where th integer denotes node[i].data.
Note: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.
Constraints

Output Format
Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.
Sample Input

Sample Output
3
Explanation
The longest root-to-leaf path is shown below:

There are  nodes in this path that are connected by  edges, meaning our binary tree's .

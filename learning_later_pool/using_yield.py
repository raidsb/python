## Understanding the `yield` Keyword in Python

**The `yield` keyword in Python is used to create generator functions.** Unlike regular functions that return a single value and terminate, generator functions can yield multiple values over time, pausing and resuming execution between each yield statement.

**Key characteristics of `yield`:**

* **Creates a generator:** When a function contains `yield`, it becomes a generator function. Calling it returns a generator object.
* **Pauses execution:** When `yield` is encountered, the function's execution pauses, and the value after `yield` is returned to the caller.
* **Resumes execution:** When the generator is called again using `next()`, the function resumes from where it left off.
* **Memory efficiency:** Generators are memory-efficient as they don't store all values at once but generate them on demand.

**Example:**

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Create a generator object
generator_obj = my_generator()

# Iterate over the generator
for value in generator_obj:
    print(value)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
```

**In the context of pytest fixtures:**
The `yield` keyword in a fixture allows you to:

* Set up resources before the test (code before `yield`).
* Provide the resource to the test function.
* Clean up resources after the test (code after `yield`).

This pattern is commonly used for managing resources like web drivers, database connections, or file handles.

## You're absolutely right!

**Each test function in pytest gets its own instance of the fixture.**

The `yield` keyword in a pytest fixture serves as a boundary between the setup phase and the test execution phase.

### Breakdown:
1. **Setup:** The code before `yield` in the fixture is executed once before each test using that fixture. This is typically used to create resources like WebDriver instances.
2. **Test Execution:** The `yield` statement passes the fixture object (e.g., the WebDriver instance) to the test function.
3. **Teardown:** The code after `yield` is executed after each test finishes, regardless of whether the test passed or failed. This is where cleanup actions like closing the browser or database connections should occur.

**By using fixtures, you ensure that each test has a clean and isolated environment.** This is crucial for reliable and repeatable test results.

How yield Works in This Context:
Setup: When a test function that uses the browser fixture is executed, the code before yield in the fixture runs first. In this case, it creates a new instance of the Chrome WebDriver (driver = webdriver.Chrome()).

Provide the Driver: The yield driver statement then pauses the execution of the fixture and provides the driver instance to the test function. The test function can now use this driver to interact with the browser.

Test Execution: The test function uses the provided driver to perform its operations (e.g., navigating to a web page, asserting titles, clicking buttons).

Teardown/Cleanup: After the test function completes, control returns to the fixture function, and any code that comes after yield would execute. This is typically where you would clean up resources. For example, you might close the browser with driver.quit().

@pytest.mark.parametrize("email, password", users)
@pytest.mark.run(order=3)
